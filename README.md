# MegaWare

MegaWare is a Python program designed to enhance security protocols by implementing robust authentication and encryption methods for Windows access. It uses password hashing, encryption, and decryption techniques to ensure secure communication and access.

## Features

- **Password Hashing**: Utilizes SHA-256 hashing for secure password storage and verification.
- **Encryption and Decryption**: Uses Fernet symmetric encryption for secure data transmission.
- **User Authentication**: Simulates user authentication with password verification.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `cryptography` library
